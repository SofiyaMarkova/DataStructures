/*
looks through string to find the longest unique string which is
a string without repeating uniqueLetters
was solved with the "sliding window" method
space complexity: O(n) because needs to go through all letters in a string x1
implementing the use of a HashSet O(1) made it more efficient than trying to store in some different list type
