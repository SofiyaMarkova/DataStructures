/*
finds the middle of the linked lists. to return the middle if odd amount nodes
and first out of the 2 middle ones if even amount nodes

using a principle of 2 pointers.
how double pointers work here:
1 pointer moves 2 nodes, the other pointer moves 1 node.
by the time that the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer be at the "middle".
so return the value at the slow "pointer" (pointer because becomes saved node into what call "slow" var of node type)

2 pointers are of big use here because it keeps the compelxity to O(n) as it only has to go
once and during the go it checks for the middle
doing 2 pointers at the same time so not have to traverse again after. saves on time complexity

time compelxity: O(n)
