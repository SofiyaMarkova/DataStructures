/*have 2D array:
want to find how many different ways can get from top left corner to bottom right corner

solved with dynamic programming because each individual square is asked
how many different ways can reach you. taking account coming from top and from left. (idea is combo of the minPathNumSum algorithm 
and the how many from each stair can get to the top if can do 1 step or 2 steps at a time)
